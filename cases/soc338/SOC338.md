## SOC338 â€“ Lumma Stealer DLL Side-Loading via Click-Fix Phishing

This case study examined a phishing campaign delivering a Lumma Stealer payload through DLL side-loading. Alerts were triggered when an unusual DLL execution chain was detected in the LetsDefend SIEM. Investigation in the SOAR and EDR dashboards traced the infection path, identifying network communication with a known command-and-control (C2) domain.

The response focused on isolating the compromised host, analysing persistence mechanisms, and evaluating user impact. The exercise reinforced understanding of end-to-end incident response and how automated playbooks within the LetsDefend platform enhance containment and reporting efficiency.
