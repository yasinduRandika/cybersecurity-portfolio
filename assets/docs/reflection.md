# ðŸ§  Reflection and Key Learning

The practical activities significantly strengthened both technical and analytical capabilities in cybersecurity operations. Through the investigations of phishing and Lumma Stealer incidents, a deeper understanding of SIEM log correlation, malware artefact analysis, and endpoint containment procedures was developed. The structured playbook approach provided clarity on the stages of the NIST CSF lifecycle, particularly in the areas of detection, response, and recovery.

The most valuable learning outcome was the improvement in interpreting complex log data and identifying malicious indicators such as MD5 hashes, C2 IPs, and suspicious email domains. At the beginning, some difficulty was encountered when linking playbook steps with real-time log evidence. However, repeated investigation practice enhanced accuracy, analytical reasoning, and decision-making confidence.

The exercises also highlighted how automation within SOAR tools reduces manual workload and improves response efficiency during live incidents. The hands-on experience demonstrated how threat intelligence, automation, and forensic verification complement each other in an operational SOC setting.

Future improvement will focus on gaining proficiency in vulnerability scanning, advanced threat-hunting, and forensic documentation to strengthen investigation depth and reporting quality. This experience has provided a solid foundation for developing into a more effective and structured cybersecurity analyst capable of managing real-world incidents.
