Automated Incident Response Using LetsDefend SOAR Platform

This portfolio demonstrates practical experience in cybersecurity operations through two case studies conducted in the LetsDefend SOC platform. The investigations involved detecting and responding to phishing and malware incidents using SIEM, SOAR, and EDR tools.

The project applied structured playbooks aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0), focusing on the Detect, Respond, and Recover phases. Each case includes detailed artefacts, screenshots, and reflections highlighting analytical reasoning, automation, and incident containment processes.

The portfolio also includes uploaded artefacts under the cases and assets folders for reference.
